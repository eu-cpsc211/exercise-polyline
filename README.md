In-class exercise for dynamic memory allocation.

You need to implement the destructor for `Polyline` and the member function `AddPoint()`. The `Polyline` class uses a dynamically allocated array of `Vector2` to store the coordinates of each point.

Further exercise: refactor the `Polyline` class to use a `vector` instead of managing a dynamic array.
